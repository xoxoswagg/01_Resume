        <p>According to media reports and trailer descriptions:

Sivakarthikeyan portrays a railway worker who becomes involved in the movement for linguistic rights.

Ravi Mohan is cast as a police officer antagonist, while Sreeleela, Atharvaa, and others play key supporting roles.

The narrative deals with political confrontation, pride in Tamil identity, and grassroots activism.

The music is composed by G. V. Prakash Kumar — marking his 100th film as a composer — and the soundtrack includes several songs released ahead of the film.

📅 Release & Censor Info

The film is slated for a Pongal release around January 10–14, 2026, though the date shifted slightly from initial plans.

Parasakthi received a U/A (Parental Guidance) certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification.

There was some censor board scrutiny because of the political themes related to Hindi imposition.

It is also dubbed in Telugu and has been distributed widely, with some controversies and competitive comparisons to Vijay’s Jana Nayagan at the box office.</p>
